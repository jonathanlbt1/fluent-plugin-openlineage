Check [CONTRIBUTING guideline](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first and here is the list to help us investigate the problem.

**Got a question or problem?**

RESOURCES of [Official site](https://www.fluentd.org/) and [Fluentd documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/) may help you.

If you have further questions about Fluentd and plugins, please direct these to [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fluentd).
Don't use Github issue for asking questions. Here are examples:

- I installed xxx plugin but it doesn't work. Why?
- Fluentd starts but logs are not sent to xxx. Am I wrong?
- I want to do xxx. How to realize it with plugins?

We may close such questions to keep clear repository for developers and users.
Github issue is mainly for submitting a bug report or feature request. See below.

If you can't judge your case is a bug or not, use mailing list or slack first.
